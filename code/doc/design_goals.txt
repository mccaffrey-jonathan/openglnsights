1) OpenGL ES2-compatible benchmarks that run on desktop GL

Desktop support for actual OpenGL ES2 + EGL is limited and inconsistent.  We will try to abstract EGL and ES2 specific details out, and use only a common subset.  Unsure how this will work for fragment shaders, we may need to check #def configs and load different shaders

2) Comparable between platforms, use off-screen fixed-size targets when possible?
1024x768 seems a reasonable size

3) Keep as many platform details out of tests as possible

4) Keep as many timing details out of tests as possible

5) Planned platform support:
Android
iOS
Ubuntu

6) Planned tests
Read accumulator test for memory bandwidth
Triangle throughput
Fill rate
Full-screen post tests:
    Single pass with vertex lighting
    Single pass with fragment lighting
    Post processing pass
    Post processing pass #2
    Both passes
    Merged passes

7) Posix ok?
All platforms we want are reasonably conformant? Except things like file-io

Goals:

Warm-up

Tear-down
Time and compute/report result
