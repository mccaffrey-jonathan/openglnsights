The integrated memory architecture of most mobile system puts
additional limits on memory bandwidth.  Unlike in most desktop systems
with dedicated graphics memory, display and rendering directly compete
with the rest of the system for bandwidth.

You can reduce memory bandwidth costs for textures reads and
framebuffer writes through changes in algorithm, resolution, and
pixel format.

The memory bandwidth consumption of the final framebuffer doesn't end
when you write it, either.  Depending on the platform, it could be read
or 2 more times before ending up on-screen.  It may need to be
composited by the platform-specific windowing system, and then scanned
out to the display.  Unlike on desktop systems which often have
dedicated graphics or framebuffer memory, this will also consume
system memory bandwidth.  

Framebuffer resolution may be difficult to reduce without affecting
quality significantly.  However, background render targets used for
reflections, shadows, and some post-processing affects may be prime
candidates for this.

Using smaller pixel formats can also yield significant space and
bandwidth savings for a minimal image quality cost.  Framebuffer
format is set with glRenderbufferStorage.  
#TODO give specific args

This is especially well-suited for the main output framebuffer, since
the loss of numerical precision won't propagate to later passes.
#TODO is that clear why?
#TODO look-up options and set 565

When using a smaller pixel format, you should be careful to inspect
areas of your scene with delicate color transitions or gradients to
make sure you don't suffer from banding.

Heavy overdraw can also cause excessive memory bandwidth consumption
on non-tile-based architectures.

On non-tile-based architectures, this extra bandwidth consumption can
limited by sorting geometry from front-to-back and limiting alpha
blending.
