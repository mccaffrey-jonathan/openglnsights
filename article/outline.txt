Discuss market
    don't waste much time here
    consumer and business/scientific (remotes, reference, reporting)
Discuss constraints (cost, die size, power, heat)
Differences of scale between mobile and desktop
    Get some rough nums
    CPU, mem BW, fill rate
Rough power/frequency/heat consumption stats? Need good source
Architectural difference veeeeeery short here
    Unified memory architecture
    Tiled, TBDR, and IM 

pixel shader work

FS post test
    Talk about common uses of FS post on desktop
        Top games, what kind of passes do they do?
    Simulate reasonable vertex lighting plus
        Nothing
        Pure readback and out
        2 filters back to back
        2 filters coalesced
            Which filters? Bloom (make it efficient)
                           Motion blur?
        Mention system-compositing here? Approaches different mobile systems take?
            Quartz?
            SurfaceFlinger?
            Is a potential perf hit

integrated_mem_perf
    Readback
    Texture upload, without blocking to use
        Make sure these agree roughly with expectations, in case of drivers doing clever things to not-do-work
    EGL Streams?
