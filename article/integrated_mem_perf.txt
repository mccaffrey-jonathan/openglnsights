A unified memory architecture presents challenges for memory bandwidth
consumption, but it does have performance advantages.  Video-to-system memory
read operations like glReadPixels and system-to-video memory write operations
like glTexImage2D can transfer data over the main memory bus, rather than
across a peripheral bus like PCIe with a discreet desktop GPU.  This allows for
comparitively higher transfer bandwidth.
#TODO numbers for readPixels and texImage2D vs memcpy

One difficulty is that there is no Pixel Buffer Object extension for OpenGL ES
2.0.  This means that all upload and download of pixel data, must be done
synchronously, with glTexImage and glReadPixels respectively.  This makes the
comparatively high bandwidth between client and server (with respect to the
performance of the rest of the system) less useful.
